"qualzed browser" or "qb". I am creating this project to understand how PyQt works on Python. 
Part of the code was made using a neural network, the other part of the code was made by me. In the future, I plan to do it myself, improve, correct and update.

# What are my plans for the project?
* I'll add history, cookie files and UI customizable.
* Add more fixes and features, you'll see it tomorrow.
* Voice query in Google or ANY other search engine
* Add languages support
